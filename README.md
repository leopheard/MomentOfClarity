Moment Of Clarity<br>
=============================

<a href="www.kodi.tv">KODI</a> / XBMC / Firestick video addon for <a href="https://leecamp.com/moment-of-clarity/">Moment Of Clarity</a> podcast.<br>

A 3 to 5-minute video rant that comes out 3 times per week. They’re written, presented, filmed, directed, and edited by me on a shitty laptop. They cover everything from my hatred of happy people to my hatred of apathy. But mainly MOC serves as a documentation of the corporate takeover of America – with jokes.<br>

Kodi (formerly known as XBMC) is an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media player and entertainment hub that can be installed on Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS and Android, featuring a 10-foot user interface for use with televisions and remote controls. It allows users to play and view most videos, music, podcasts, and other digital media files from local and network storage media and the internet.<br>

^^^ To install this addon, either use the <a href="https://www.tvaddons.co/github-browser-kodi/">Kodi Github installer</a> addon or save the .zip file downloaded from the 'clone or download' button to somewhere the Kodi can access (e.g. network drive or USB stick). Then on the Kodi, go to addons > install from zip file.<br>
